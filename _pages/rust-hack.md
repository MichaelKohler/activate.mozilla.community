## Impact and Metrics

The Rust programming language will be important to the future of the web, making it safe and great. Having more developers understand, use and evangelize this language will advance make the web better and more secure.

Rust is used extensively for Mozilla projects -- including this year as Servo (written in Rust) is advanced even further, and parts of it are moved into Gecko/Firefox. Having more Mozilla contributors know Rust will give them a chance to contribute to the most exciting and important technical projects coming up for Mozilla.

Rust is also a good project to be engaged in for people that don't want or can't participate in a Mozilla project, but like to be involved with something close.

### Goals for this area

__Impact:__

* 1,000 programmers are introduced to and are well on their way to learning Rust
* 10 ongoing Rust Hack and Learn events
* 500 social media shares
* Each organizer schedules 3 Rust Hack and Learn events

__Strength:__

* 50 Mozillians organize Rust Hack and Learn events
* 1-2 people join [Rust teams]

[Rust teams]: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html

## Audience for this activity

Your audience for this event should be **programmers and developers**. Focus on people who are technical and already know languages like C or Python or other similar languages. Some outreach to beginners can be done.

Having more developers understand, use and evangelize this language will advance make the web better and more secure. Rust is also a great way to learn about WebAssembly.

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. [Find out more...](https://www.rust-lang.org)

## Activity Format

Get your community behind this exciting new programming language by running a learning event.

1. Put an event team together. Going alone is fine, but at least two people is advisable. Get in touch with the [[Rust Community Team](mailto:community@rust-lang.org)] and check the [Rust Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=apd9vmbc22egenmtu5l6c5jbfc@group.calendar.google.com) - maybe there's already people in your area.
2. Try to find people with Rust experience who want to help. If you find none, this is fine - many Hack and Learns started out by curious people.
3. Choose a date and secure a venue. Fill the [event template](https://github.com/rust-community/events-team/issues/new?template=new_meetup.md&labels=meetup) for access to the calendar so that you can enter it there.  It will then be sent around with Rusts weekly newsletter and promoted in other fashions.
4. Setup the event on Reps Portal ([instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Event_hosting)). Please make sure the initiative is set to "MozActivate" and the functional area indicates "Rust".
5. Get [Material](https://github.com/rust-community/resources) and print them to hand them out. You can also ask the [Rust Community Team](mailto:community@rust-lang.org) if they can send some stickers.

For duration, we recommend at least 2-3 hours event with a minimum of 10 attendees.

Some Mozillians have already done such sessions. For example our [Community Spaces](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation/Community_Spaces) have, so you can reach out the them to ask for some guidance.

## Event Flow

* Install Rust
    * [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs) - recommended
    * [Rust downloads](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/other-installers.html) (alternative)
- Get started!
    * Read the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
    * Check [Rust by Example](https://rustbyexample.com/)
    * Complete some [Rustlings](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings) (a great beginners course!)
    * Try to form some groups to find things they'd like to program.

## Directly at the end of the activity
Immediately after the event don’t forget to share the link to the impact form with your attendees:

{: .attention-link}
[mzl.la/howwasit](http://mzl.la/howwasit)

Remember this is how you’ll know who attended your event, and if you successfully inspired them to action! We recommend adding it to your final slide AND emailing it out after the event.

## Other Resources

### Tutorials

* [Niko Matsakis's excellent slide deck](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorials-keynote)
* [Exercises to accompany that deck](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorializer)
* [A screencast from Niko on ownership and borrowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCUBSbJENO4)

## Output
Additional to the recommended event flow here are some things we’d like you, the event organizer, to do.

* Fill out the post-event metrics on the event page you setup on the Reps portal
* Optionally, tell us about your event. This can be before or after. We love to hear about upcoming plans, and of course love to hear about what was achieved at the event with a picture or two! This will also be instructional and inspirational to others who might do the event.
    * [Here is the Discourse post to write to](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/activate-mozilla-dive-into-rust/10073/1)

## Extra
While the focus of this activity should be on these events, people can get more involved more involved with the Rust community after.

* Follow up with attendees to highlight [more things happening in the community to get involved with](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/community.html)
