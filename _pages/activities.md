## Activities

These activities were designed with 2 things in mind:

1. That they have the potential to have a direct impact on Mozilla’s work right now
2. That they bring value to you and your community. While we have specific metrics for each activity, one of the main overall goals is that we all get better at mobilising and building communities.

Before you jump right in: Look at your goals for the year, what do you and your community want to accomplish in each of the impact areas? Which of the following activities best map to those goal? And very importantly, ask yourself if by doing these activities you can expose new people to the work that Mozilla is doing and we can build new communities around them.

## Community Participation Guidelines
Larissa Shapiro, and the D&I Team at Mozilla have been busy this year, developing a 2.0 of the [Mozilla Community Participation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) Guidelines(CPG), and we are bringing [this draft to you](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sElGXuZ0W31iPshvmj0CR2f6woF6V8wqrrJHzJ0pnpU/edit#heading=h.rf21kwgxk0hb), Mozilla's community, for feedback before release in early April. Completing this activity is a valuable contribution to Mozilla, and recognition of that contribution is included as a final step. [Find out more](/community-participation-guideline/).

## Dive Into Rust
Rust is a systems programming language important to the future of the web. It runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. With your help, we want more developers to understand, use and evangelize this language in order to make the web better and more secure.

## Web Compatibility Sprint
Web Compatibility, the ability for all Web content to run in all browsers, is important. There are multiple web content engines running on multiple devices, and sometimes with a little testing and some small tweaks to their site, developers can ensure that more users can have the full experience that is desired. Test sites and spread the message about compatibility.
